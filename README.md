# BreakOut-CS50-
Its a game written in C.
Well the game is inspired from the breakout game which steve jobs degigned when he was at Atari.
We have a paddle to control the motion of ball and prevent it to fell down and a ball which breaks the bricks above. 
Using SPL ( Stanford portable library) for the GUI
